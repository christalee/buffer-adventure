# buffer-adventure
A Python text-adventure game, adapted from an OO assignment originally in Scheme. Originally a project to review multiple inheritance, then an excuse to see how a test suite (pytest) and type checking (mypy) can make refactoring less painful.

This project is not finished, but it is playable, by running `python setup.py`. Your character can move around, pick up objects, punch people and vampires, and learn to hack. Type `q` to quit.
