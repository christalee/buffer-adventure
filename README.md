# buffer-adventure
A Python text-adventure game, adapted from an OO assignment originally in Scheme. First a project to review multiple inheritance, then an excuse to see how a test suite ([pytest](https://docs.pytest.org/en/latest/index.html)) and type checking ([mypy](https://mypy.readthedocs.io/en/latest/index.html#)) can make refactoring less painful.

This project is not finished, but it is playable, by running `python setup.py`. Your character can move around, pick up objects, attack people (who may be vampires), and learn to hack. Type `q` to quit.
